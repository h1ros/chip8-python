# Welcome to chip8-python!

This project aims to create a chip-8 emulator to experience emulator development. Chip-8 is known for one of the easiest and most educational emulator to develop as the first step if you are interested in emulator.  

# Audience
* those who has knowledge Python programming
* those who has basic knowledge about computer
* those who wants to start developing emulator or curious how emulators work. 

# Rule
This project follows the rules below.

1. Read a manual / documentation like [Wiki CHIP-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8#Virtual_machine_description) or guidance / tutorial like [blog - write a chip8 emulator](https://tobiasvl.github.io/blog/write-a-chip-8-emulator/)
2. Don't look at other's implementation or code itself unless absolutely necessary or inevitable.
